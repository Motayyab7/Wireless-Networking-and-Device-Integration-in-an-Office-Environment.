Overview
-

In this project, I configured various wireless technologies to establish connectivity for different devices within an office setting using Cisco Packet Tracer. The objective was to simulate real-world networking scenarios involving wireless LAN (WLAN), Bluetooth, and cellular tethering. By completing this project, I gained practical experience with networking concepts and device configurations in a controlled virtual environment.

Objectives
-

Connect a Laptop to the Office WLAN:

I installed and configured a wireless network module on a laptop.
I connected the laptop to a specified office wireless network (SSID).
I verified network connectivity by obtaining an IP address and accessing a web resource.
Connect Devices with Bluetooth Technology:

I enabled and configured Bluetooth ports on a Bluetooth speaker and an office tablet.
I paired the Bluetooth speaker with the office tablet.
I tested the Bluetooth connection by playing and stopping music on the tablet.
Tether a Laptop to Use a Cellular Network via the Smartphone:

I configured Bluetooth and cellular settings on a smartphone.
I enabled Bluetooth on a laptop and connected it to the smartphone for internet access.
I verified connectivity by browsing a web resource through the cellular network.

Expected Outcomes
-

Wireless Module Installation:
I learned to install and configure a wireless network module on a laptop, transitioning from a wired to a wireless connection.

WLAN Connectivity:
I successfully connected the laptop to the office WLAN by selecting the correct SSID, entering the pre-shared key, and confirming connectivity through IP assignment and web access.

Bluetooth Pairing:
I configured Bluetooth settings on both a Bluetooth speaker and an office tablet, successfully pairing them to enable audio playback through the speaker.

Cellular Tethering:
I set up a smartphone to provide cellular network access to a laptop via Bluetooth tethering, allowing the laptop to browse the web using the smartphone’s cellular connection.

Tools and Resources
-

Packet Tracer: Latest version for virtual device configuration and simulation.
Devices: Laptop, Bluetooth speaker, office tablet, and smartphone with Bluetooth and cellular capabilities.

Procedure
-
I installed and configured the wireless module on the laptop.
I connected the laptop to the office WLAN and verified network access.
I enabled Bluetooth on the speaker and tablet, paired them, and tested audio playback.
I configured cellular tethering on the smartphone, enabled Bluetooth, and connected the laptop to use the smartphone’s cellular network for web access.

Tips for Success
-
I ensured devices were powered on and properly configured.
I followed each step methodically to avoid missing configuration details.
I used the Packet Tracer simulation tools to troubleshoot and verify connectivity as needed.
I was patient when waiting for device discoveries and connections to establish.
This project allowed me to enhance my understanding of network connectivity, device configuration, and the use of various wireless technologies in an office environment.
